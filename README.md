# History of Super Bowl Commercials

As a non-American who follows marketing and ad-tech news regularly, every year around Super Bowl time, I start to see news about Super Bowl commercials and their astronomical price tags, and I have always had this question in my mind — why are advertisers so eager to spend millions to place an ad at Super Bowl, especially with the social media bloom and ever-changing advertising landscape?

I found the dataset browsing Maven Analytics’ data playground (yet again, but it is also accessible on Kaggle).

The dataset is relatively clean and straightforward, I did not feel the need to do any additional data wrangling, so I went straight to Tableau for data exploration, visualization and story telling.

## Data Exploration and Storytelling

The main question I tried to answer with this analysis was simple — what’s the winning strategy for advertisers to get the best ROI on their spend?

To answer the question, I first of all needed a way to measure the ROI. With the limited amount of data I had, I decided that a good ROI indicator would be a cost/view ratio — how many views does an ad get for each dollar spent?

With that in mind, I looked for potential correlations and trends between the ROI and other variables, including year, cost, views and elements of the ads.
